# The Ballerina Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Visual Studio Code Ballerina extension provides a set of rich language features along with an enhanced user experience. 
It offers easy development, execution, debugging, and testing for the Ballerina programming language. 
The Ballerina language possesses a bidirectional mapping between its syntaxes and the visual representation. 
You can further visualize the graphical representation of your Ballerina source via the extension.

<details>
<summary>Debugging</summary>

The VS Code Ballerina language extension comes with in-built debugging capabilities and provides the same debugging experience as the conventional VS Code Debugging.

##### Starting a Debug Session

We can start a quick debug session instantly to debug a ballerina program with `CodeLens`. We also can start a debug session with configurations
like program arguments and environment variables by adding them into the `launch.json` file.

###### Starting a Program Debug Session

Ballerina extension provides multiple options to debug your Ballerina program and the easiest way will be using our context-aware `Debug` CodeLens support provided by the extension.
The extension can detect any program entry points (main function/service definition) on the fly, and the CodeLens will appear automatically.  

Follow the steps below to start a quick debug session.

![Start_Main Quick Debug Session](/learn/images/start-quick-main-debug-session.gif)

<br/>

1. Open the folder, which includes the Ballerina program you want to debug, and open the source file in the editor.

2. Add the debug points you require by clicking in front of the line numbers of the file you want to debug.

3. Click the `Debug` CodeLens which is just above the `main()` method.

###### Starting a Test Debug Session

The Ballerina test functions can also be debugged using the codelens. The `debug` codelens will automatically appear on top of each Ballerina test function and the users are able to execute/debug only a selected test case by clicking on the corresponding codelens, as shown below.

![Start_Test Quick Debug Session](/learn/images/start-quick-test-debug-session.gif)

<br/>

###### Debug Session with Configurations

Follow the steps below to start a debug session with configurations. All the configurations need to be added in the `launch.json` file.

![Start Debug Session](/learn/images/start-debug-session.gif)

<br/>

1. Open the folder, which includes the Ballerina program you want to debug, and select the file.

2. Press the **Control + Shift + D** keys (for Mac: **Command + Shift +D**) to launch the Debugger view.

3. Click **create a launch.json** file and then select **Ballerina Debug** as the **Environment**.

###### Starting a Remote Debug Session

Follow the steps below to start a remote debug session.

1. Create the `launch.json` configuration file if it is not created already. Refer [Debug Session with Configurations](#debug-session-with-configurations) section on how to create the `launch.json` file.

2. Open `launch.json` file and configure `debuggeeHost` and `debuggeePort` attributes under `Ballerina Remote` configurations section accordingly.

3. After setting the remote debug configurations, select **Ballerina Remote** from the drop-down available in the upper left corner to start a remote debugging session.

4. Open the Terminal and execute the Ballerina command, which you want to debug, out of the supported remote debugging commands below. 

    - Debugging a Ballerina package or a single file: 

    ```bash
    bal run --debug <DEBUGGEE_PORT> <BAL_FILE_PATH/PACKAGE_PATH>
    ```

   - Debugging Ballerina executable JAR:  

    ```bash 
    bal run --debug <DEBUGGEE_PORT> <EXECUTABLE_JAR_FILE_PATH>
    ```

    - Debugging Ballerina tests: 

    ```bash
    bal test --debug <DEBUGGEE_PORT> <PACKAGE_PATH>
    ```
    
    The terminal will show the following log:

    ```bash
    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
    ```

5. Click the **Start Debugging** icon on the upper left corner to start debugging.

    You view the output in the **DEBUG CONSOLE**.

<br/>

Here are the default configurations generated for the Ballerina debugging:

![Debug Configurations](/learn/images/debug-configurations.png)

<br/>

>**Info:** You can debug a Ballerina program without generating the `launch.json` configurations file, but it is not possible to manage launch configurations and set up advanced debugging.

###### Ballerina launch.json attributes

The auto-generated `launch.json` file consists of three main configurations, namely, `Ballerina Debug`, `Ballerina Test`, and `Ballerina Remote`. Each configuration supports different attributes, and those attributes can be identified with the help of IntelliSense suggestions (`⌃Space`).

The following attributes are mandatory for all configurations.

- `name` - The reader-friendly name to appear in the Debug launch configuration dropdown.
- `type` - The type of debugger to use for this launch configuration. The attribute value must be kept as `ballerina` for all Ballerina debugging configuration types.
- `request` - The request type of this launch configuration. Currently, launch and attach are supported.

The following attributes are supported for all Ballerina `launch` configurations.

- `programArgs` - Any program arguments that are required to be passed into the `main` function of the Ballerina program to be launched, can be passed as a list of strings.
- `commandOptions` - If required, you can configure command options for the Ballerina program to be launched, as a list of strings. You can see the list of all the available command options by executing the following CLI commands in your terminal.
    - For `Ballerina Debug` configuration:

    ```bash
    bal run --help
    ```

    - For `Ballerina Test` configuration:

    ```bash
    bal test --help
    ```

- `env` - Any environment variables you need to configure for the launching Ballerina program can be passed as a map of strings (name and value).
- `debugTests` - Indicates whether to debug the tests for the given script.

The following attributes are supported for all Ballerina `attach` configurations.

- `debuggeeHost` - Host address of the remote process to be attached (If not specified, the default value will be the localhost(`127.0.0.1`)).
- `debuggeePort` - Port number of the remote process to be attached.

<summary>Code Navigation</summary>

##### Go to Definition 

For a symbol, this feature will navigate you to the definition of the particular symbol. For example, when invoking the go to definition from a function call expression, you will be navigated to the definition of the function. Apart from jumping to the definition, the peek definition will also be supported. The behavior will be the same not only for the constructs within the sources in the current package but also for external modules and standard libraries as well.

![Go to Definition](/learn/images/go-to-definition.gif)

##### Find all References

Invoking the references on a symbol will prompt you with all the symbol references in the current package.

![Find all References](/learn/images/find-all-references.gif)

#### Rename Symbols
This feature allows you to rename symbols by renaming all the references of the particular symbol.
